# Variant Analysis

This stage involves identifying and annotating genetic variants.

## Variant Calling
- Detect SNPs, INDELs, structural variants using tools such as GATK or FreeBayes
- Output: Variant call files (VCF)

## Export Variants
- Convert detected variants into VCF format for sharing and annotation

## Annotation & Filtering
- Add functional information to variants (e.g., gene impact)
- Filter variants based on quality, frequency, and impact

## Matching Variants
- Compare variants to reference databases to identify known and novel variants
- Find matches and differences relevant to the study

This process helps identify genetic variations associated with traits or diseases.
