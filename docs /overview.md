# Pipeline Overview

The genetic data processing pipeline transforms raw biological samples into actionable genetic insights. The main stages include:

- **Sample Collection:** Gathering biological samples (blood, saliva)
- **Data Extraction:** Extracting DNA/RNA
- **Sequencing:** Generating raw sequencing data
- **Data Cleaning & Trimming:** Improving data quality
- **Alignment:** Mapping reads to reference genome
- **Variant Calling:** Detecting genetic variants
- **Annotation & Filtering:** Adding functional info and filtering variants
- **Matching & Results:** Comparing variants to databases and generating reports
- **Interpretation:** Researchers analyze the results for insights

Each step is crucial for ensuring data accuracy and meaningful analysis.
