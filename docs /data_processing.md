# Data Processing

This section covers the steps from raw sequencing data to aligned reads.

## Data Extraction
- Extract DNA or RNA from biological samples

## Sequencing
- Generate raw sequencing data (FASTQ files)

## Data Cleaning & Trimming
- Remove low-quality bases and adapters
- Perform quality control checks
- Output: Cleaned and trimmed FASTQ files

## Alignment
- Map reads to the reference genome using tools like BWA or Bowtie2
- Output: Aligned BAM/SAM files

Proper data cleaning and alignment are crucial for accurate variant detection.
